# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end credit risk analysis using customer-level financial and demographic data. The objective is to identify key factors associated with credit default and to build a simple, interpretable predictive model suitable for a junior data analyst context.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on 1,200 customers, including age, income, employment status, residence status, banking relationship duration, and credit history. A binary target variable indicates whether a customer defaulted on credit obligations.

## Key Insights
- The overall default rate is approximately 33%, indicating a relevant credit risk scenario.
- Higher default rates are associated with lower income levels and shorter relationships with the bank.
- Tenants show higher default rates compared to homeowners.
- Customers with unknown employment status present significantly higher credit risk.
- Clients without prior credit history tend to default more frequently.

## Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and risk patterns.
- Categorical risk analysis using normalized cross-tabulations.
- Feature preparation and development of a baseline logistic regression model to predict default.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
